# Cam to Hue
Cam to Hue is a Rust program that takes input from a /dev/video* device,
picks the most dominant colors and outputs them in the form of changing
your Philips Hue lights.

## It's slow
I know. Feel free to help out (mainly by improving color extraction which is
currently done with exoquant) by sending in a pull request.

## I'm new to Rust
There are probably a lot of mistakes and "bad habits" in here. Feel free to
point them out to me! I always seek to improve my coding skills and getting
input from others is usually the quickest way to go about that. You can reach me
